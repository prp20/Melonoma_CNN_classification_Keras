# Melonoma_CNN_classification_Keras

This is CNN based classification of the Melonoma Cancer Dataset which contains images of 9 classes of nine different classes of images.
Three types of models are being used to identify the dataset images.
Steps Followed:
- Read the dataset.
- Visualize the dataset.
- Create a dataset using the image_utils function.
- normalize the dataset
- Run on Basic model
- Observe the accuracy and loss
- model 2 with dropout as model 1 was overfitting.
- model 2 has lower accuracy as some classes have lesser number of images.
- create augmentations and inacrease the number of images in the dataset.
- model 3 built using the updated dataset along with dropout.
- model 3 has updated accuracy and loss.

This repo contains the jupyter notebook file which contains the various models using dataset.
